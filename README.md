# 1-16-Makeup

The class went over CSS positioning and float, github pushes and pulls, and the details of static/relative/absolute/fixed positioning.

The activities covered were under the 01-html-git-css unit: 06-HTML_CSS_Layout and 11-CSS_Positioned_Activity. I've completed them, and my solutions are found in the repo.
